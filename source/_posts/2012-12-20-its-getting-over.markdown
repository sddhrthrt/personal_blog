So days are flying. Our research is finally taking some shape.

I understood the algorithms and the theory behind what we are doing, now. I can 
even give an 'Elevator Speech' about our topic now! 

There were a couple of 'How to write a research paper' lectures. 
One made me think we almost had a research paper, while the other made me think I'm an idiot! The second was a formal one
where emphasis was on the methodology, 'research behind the research' and so on, which was
for serious, big papers. I couldn't follow much of it.

Anyway, now that we have most of our code figured out, I left it for my teammates to finish it. Well,
I haven't introduced to you both of them, Hardik Sanghvi, Madhumita Kedlaya - students of
Electronics Engineering from MS Ramai'y'ah College.

Food is great. MSRIT has provided some good food these days, keeping me full all the time. No, not 
even the occasional snacks. Except the _midnight snack_, as always. 

Well... I guess I'll tell if there's any solid result from our research - tomorrow will be
the D-Day when the code will be ready.

Tata!
