I am a Tata DOCOMO subscriber for the last 3 years, as far as I remember. It's a
service that is available in towns and not so prominent in villages. I face
trouble when I go back to my hometown, but I bear with it for the good offers
they have.

Nonetheless, the relationship with this network has not been sweet always. There
are far many incidents I remember when they took away my money for no apparent
mistake of mine, but then I had customer support, whom I could contact for
clarification/refund whenever applicable. I think when we pay an entity large
amounts of money without real receipt/acknowledgement, the customer support
plays a very important role in creating trust. Prompt, responsible customer care
means one can ensure that his money is in safe hands.

Recently, Tata DOCOMO has become outrageous in terms of customer support,
honesty and responsibility. I wish to detail this one encounter among the
numerous ones that I had with this company.

## The story
I received a message after a call along with the call cost report saying:
"RC250 for 222.5 Talktime and 1GB 3G internet valid for 30 days". I immediately
thought this was a very good offer and I proceeded to recharge.

I got these options, in which I tried Special recharge, which didn't have the
denomination I was looking for. 3G recharge obviously meant 3G packs, so I went
for Top-Up. 250 denomination was present, which I chose.

Now, I proceeded to the next steps and finished recharging using Net Banking.
When I was done, I eagerly opened the phone and reactivated internet only to see
a 'E' in the top of the screen, as usual, and I couldn't use any fast internet.
I immediately suspected something wrong and called the customer care
representative at 121.

## The misery of Customer "Care"
Customer care is another story with Tata DOCOMO. They connect you only once in
24 hours. Whenever else, you get a blunt response : "All our customer care
representatives are busy helping other customers.". That's it. So I decided that
I am talking all the details that I need when I call. So having a sketch - ask
about 3G data I have, if not, clarify about recharge, and ask them to correct
the mistake and activate 3G.

A customer care representative picked my call, and asked about my problem. She
came up with this equally irresponsible, rather funny response:
"Sir, this recharge is available only if you do it with one of our retailers,
and online recharge does not give you any data.". Then, to my surprise and
anger, she disconnected the call.

Later, I tried more than 50 times during the day, within 4 hours, for no avail.
All our customer care representatives are busy attending other customers, they
said, adding "for further support, contact D**ss*nt@tatadocomo.com". This word
is indecipherable. I listened to the same recorded voice again and again, in
vain, trying to decode that particular word.

## The wonderful website
Now, I thought the only option left is internet. I visit www.tatadocomo.com, and
navigate through their cumbersome interface and find this option: __Customer Care
-> Complaints and Compliments -> Register your Complaint__. I found this
page.

Here, as soon as I enter my phone number and click on the Salutation column, the
whole page refreshes, and shows this dumb message:

I had already logged in, so what did register for my Account mean? I didnt know.
I decided to click on the __"Click Here"__ link. And voila, look what happened:

There you go. Notice carefully, the inner page is the same template as of the outer page.
Also, this is not just once. It happens infinite times -

The last way to voice our dissent is also *poof* gone. I couldn't just talk to
anyone.

## Summary

Now I realize the gravity of the situation:

* The industry is becoming autocratic - it doesn't bother about the customer
  anymore.
* Customer care is no longer important, even if we pay for the service
  before/without knowing if we actually will get the service.
* Special offers - they dont have any official documentation. They will
  disappear on the click of the button and may never be shown again. And the
  company might say "We didn't send any such offer" or "You should have known
  better".
* Customer care is irresponsible - they cut your calls, give you blunt replies,
  they stonewall you and never connect your call - afterall they control your
  calls!
* You have to pay for the service before you get it. You cant even be sure what
  you get and if you will get or not.

I know most of you are wondering why I dont go to the customer court and instead
whine here. It doesn't make sense to go to the customer court for even small
issues like this - and they know it, so they exploit customers using small
issues like this! Who would go to court or speak out about this? None!

I wonder if this will become the norm tomorrow. I wonder if the transparency and
honesty that was with these telecom is slowly replaced with arrogance,
dishonesty and cheap tactics. I wonder this is the beginning of
the sad demise of telecom industry.
