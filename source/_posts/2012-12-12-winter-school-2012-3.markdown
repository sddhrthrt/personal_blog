It's [12-12-12][12].

It's the third day's end (almost). It's been rich with research experience, some actual thinking, 
excellent sessions of explanation of topics, great teacher interaction, etc.

It began with a boring lecture from a local professor. I always liked to believe one shouldn't belittle
Indian teachers as we all tend to do when some other teacher is around (or not, for that matter). But
this man broke all my belief. <!--more-->He read the presentation out loudly, he sounded extremely boring and 
he even agreed that he had scammed the presentation.

Moving on, students of our group presented a topic or tool each. I couldn't, for I took all the time
to just learn the background (and watched telemarketing and tried [Sheershasana][sheershasana] and 
bugged the hotel manager). My turn is tomorrow.

The best part came when our teacher said, we'll look at a sample of human speech, explaining [preemphasis][emph], 
and pulled up an audio clip of the morning's lecture. We were cursing fate for having to listen to him again,
and even planned of a brand new project idea - automatic presentation forwarding based on the _reader_'s voice!
Well, he had actually read the presentation, so it was going to be a fairly easy task!

Evening was getting better, when we discovered the heavenly internet speeds bestowed to us by MSR college. That
combined with the google query {% highlight url %}intitle:'index of' <your favorite film here>.mkv {% endhighlight %}I used
it to download [Matlab][matlab]Â® for Linux and installed it. Just because there was bandwidth. Now I'm thinking
what else to do.

After some helping (forced) to Prakhar, I suddenly got excited about python programming, and realized why
I was not using my favorite tool to do my project. Then, I discovered [scikit-learn][scikit-learn] with
the help of a FatA - and ran a program using [scipy][scipy] - and got [MFCC][mfcc] output.
Well, I'm gonna do some reading now and present some thing tomorrow and then start coding in Python!
