Dear YouTube,

I know you do all sorts of good and bad things. But here are my concerns:
* So, now you want to show me the video I want only 50% the time. Rest, yeah. Ads.
* THE INFINITE LOOP. Do you have only 3 advertisements? Why do you keep looping between them?
* If you _want_ to play the same ads for me, don't stream them again and again. Yes, here in India, even 2 GB costs a lot.
<!-- more -->
* Wait, you want to restart the ad if I exit fullscreen? I didn't resize the window to see the ad again, I did it to change tabs.
* Yes, you showed me the Susan Boyle + Elaine Page duet right after I watched the audition. But why the 31s of crap in between?
* You did recommend me the finals of that show after the semifinals. But the grey ad banner was so big, I thought you ran out of videos and I closed the tab.
* I did catch a glimpse of the final, though. But now I couldn't go back there, because either I had to go through the whole series of recommendations from where I started, or I'd have to manually search for it.

Wait, you do an amazing job always. When you resume the buffer from the previous play
if I accidentally close a tab. You recognize my liking and disliking. You recommend
the right part of the current series. But... Why the incompetent playlist? Why open a new
page in the same tab when I haven't logged in and clicked the like button (and make me
lose all the buffered part AND make me seek to the right point again) ?

Yours,
