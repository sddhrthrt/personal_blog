The other day, I was asked (or rather, I volunteered, seeing the need for it) to
give a motivational talk for my juniors in school now. They are 17-18 and are
preparing to get out of school for a competitive world ahead - cut-throat,
severe, merciless - and will usually be confused with which option to choose,
how to prepare for all the options, which to leave and which to prepare for.
Mental fatigue follows. One usually needs a peer to talk them through such time,
get someone who went through the same situation to tell them it's okay and they
have to keep going.

That's why I thought I could talk to them informally for some time, as a small
help to my _alma mater_. So there I was, in front of 40 tired, hard-working and
under-pressure kids.

## The biggest challenges.

In the situation that they are in, after about 6 months into their final year of
schooling, just 3 months to go for their final exams and more competitive exams
to follow, they are in a crunch situation, with heavy loads on their brains,
physically tired and overworked.  The most important challenges they face now
are, from my experience,

* Being tired of studying. 
* Too much work, too less time.
* Too much to study. Huge syllabus ahead.

### Tired?

So there is this story about a cat that fell inside the well. The owner of the
well decides that he wants to fill up the dry well in his garden so he could
build something better on that piece of land. He hires someone to clear the
land, level it and put the soil they dig up into the dry well and fill it up.

The workers start the work, but they don't realize there is a exhausted cat
inside the well, unable to shout for help, not able to come out. They started
with the digging, and put the first load of soil into the well. 

The cat jumped awake, and realized it was under a few inches of soil. Frightened
for life, it tries to shake the mud off and climbed out of the mud. Then came
another load of mud. Fighting for life, it shook off the mud again. 

But the work was progressing in swift pace and the cat had to shake off the mud
on it and come on top of the mud in the well. It kept doing the same thing all
the time, till the well was Full of mud, and it walked away to freedom.

What if the cat had taken a few minutes to relax, stretch and catch a breath? It
could've got under a few feet of mud and would have had to rest in peace there.
Similar to the situation, out in the world of education, there's severe
competition. One has to stay one step ahead of the world around, constantly
updating himself and never be resting. 

I told them they had to be like that cat, relaxing for a few moments but never
lose the momentum. Then one could hope to keep up with the best and not be
burdened heavily at any time. To relax _and_ study at the same time was the way
to go. It's called *active studyng*, and it involves not getting lost or tired
during studying. Taking regular breaks, never over-burdening oneself, keeping a
regular schedule and planning one's course of study properly will help one to
study without getting tired.

Okay, this post has gone too long already. The talk went on for some more time,
where I gave them some time-tested methods to counter time management issues and
also effective studying methods. Surprise that it came from me, someone who
fails miserably at managing time, isn't it?
