There are several reasons why vim is the best friend of a keyboard warrior.
The ever-lasting emacs-vim war aside, I think vim is the best way to interact
with your computer. For me the philosophy of vim is fascinating and I love it
and I use it wherever I can. Today it just got better for me, and I'm
going to show how.

So I was doing this usual business of going through hackernews and /r/hacking
and /r/technology, and I come across this article where someone said - I badly
want to remember who, but I am not able to - he uses vim, vimperator and i3. I
blindly clicked on the hyperlinks to discover two beautiful things I'm gonna
use for a very long time now - vimperator (and it's counterpart vrome) and i3. 

## vimperator (vrome) - browse vim style

[vimperator](www.vimperator.org/vimperator) is an add-in for firefox. It gives
the user the ability to use firefox as if it were vim. No I'm not talking about
a text-based browser, I'm talking about the normal firefox with a vim-like
keyboard interface. It adds a sleuth of abilities to firefox including
hjkl-movements, ex commands, marks, tab-completion and so many others I can't
yet fathom a browser can have yet.  
[vrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vrome/godjoomfiimiddapohpmfklhgmbfffjj)
- the counterpart for vimperator on google-chrome. vrome takes it a step further
with a menu appearing whenever you type `:` (obviously not within a text box).
The range of commands available at hand in both vimperator and vrome is
amazing.

## i3: refreshing! 

Now I set out to try [i3](i3wm.org): the other thing that grabbed my attention.
While I had my antennas focused because of the term `tiling window manager`, I
never expected something so nice. i3 turns out to be an easy-to-install tiling
window manager that imbibes most of the vim philosophy.

There's a nice manual on how to install it on almost any flavor of linux,
especially debian. (I use an Ubuntu 12.04, and I used to use Unity/awesomewm till
now.) Once installed, it gave me two important things: the i3 wm itself,
accessible from gdm on log-in and the `i3bar`, the taskbar on the bottom.
Everything just worked, inluding the default settings wizard, the `nm-applet`, and
the very useful `dmenu`. I was underway in a matter of minutes because it was
all familiar `vim` territory.

Apart from being a vim-inspired wm, i3 also stresses on having a clean codebase,
very nice hackability and great manuals - just what you need for a stong open
source project.  

Overall, today has been one of those days when your laptop suddenly gets this
huge makeover and facelift (not always). This time, I doubt if I'll ever go
back.
