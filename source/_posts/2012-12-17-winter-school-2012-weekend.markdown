Here comes the weekend. Like a spring that lost a huge attached weight, I sprang
to my usual mode - relax, tv, roam, eat, chat. 

The weekend actually began with the program on Friday - _TGIF_!
Bharathanatyam, porki dance, some impromptu english/hindi songs, retro hindi karaoke, and a good dinner later,
I was having the best time of this vacation. We learned that [David Adamson][david],Octopress
who is a grad student of CMU and one of our guides, has an office close to the inventor
of smileys - :-) - [Scott Fahlman][scott].
<!-- more -->

The night was spent watching random videos, and the best find was the kid [Jack Vedgen][jack].
Simply amazing. After being amazed, I sleep at 4AM, wake up at 11AM and realize that I was all alone.
Rest of the weekend was simply spent lazing around, roaming with friends and
sleeping. The week has taken a toll on me.
