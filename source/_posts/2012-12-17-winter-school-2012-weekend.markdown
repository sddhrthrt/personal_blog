Then came the weekend. Like a spring that lost a huge attached weight, I sprang
to my usual mode - relax, tv, roam, eat, chat. 

The weekend actually began with the program on Friday - _TGIF_!
Bharathanatyam, porki dance, some impromptu english/hindi songs, retro hindi karaoke, and a good dinner later,
I was having the best time of this vacation. We learned that [David Adamson][david],Octopress
who is a grad student of CMU and one of our guides, has an office close to the inventor
of smileys - :-) - [Scott Fahlman][scott].
<!-- more -->

The night was spent watching random videos, and the best find was the kid [Jack Vedgen][jack].
Simply amazing. After being amazed, I sleep at 4AM, wake up at 11AM and realize that I was all alone.

The food hunt in Mathikere went on without incident, just because there were no eateries. Ah, there are.
One whose kitchen we pass by every day and I know the internals. OctopressOctopressOctopress
