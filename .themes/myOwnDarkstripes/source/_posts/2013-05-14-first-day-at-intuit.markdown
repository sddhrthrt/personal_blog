Le me dozing off in Intuit office - jobless on the first day - on my comfortable
SteelCase chair.

"Hey, Wake up!"  

I'm up. It's my mentor Harsh Vardhan Gupta. He has a serious look on his face, and his phone in his hand.  

"The team manager is back from the US. He tried to wake you up, but you wouldn't respond. He called me."

I took a few more moments, still sleepy after the heavy lunch.  

"He just came in. He wanted to see you, but he found you sleeping with Facebook open on your
screen. He's pissed off!"   

I slowly realized the gravity of the situation. I just screwed up my first meeting with my team manager. I probably even screwed up my
chances with Intuit.  

"What? Did he come in? He saw me sleeping?", I asked, rubbing my eyes.    

"Yes, he tried to wake you up. He's off for a meeting now. He asked me to send him your phone number.", he said, and in a hurry took down my
number on his mobile.   

"Alright, he's angry, so probably you should see him as soon as he's back!"   

The colleagues voiced their concern, too. "Harsh, you meet
the manager first!", "Siddhartha, go apologize!", "He's not that bad either, he
might forgive you..", they said. Nothing helped the mood.

I washed my face. Tried to do something work-related, but was just plain worried. I
was imagining the manager, and was nervous like shit.

Then the whole office burst out into laughter, and they come and pat my back and
apologize.

The manager is still in the US. Intuit doesn't care if we sleep during work,
heck, they even have a sleeping room. Intuit has begun well indeed.
